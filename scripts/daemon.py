# Daemon
# ======
#
# The daemon is responsible for issuing commands to all other containers. As
# such, the daemon is essentially just running a bunch of docker exec's.
#
# The daemon is created before all other containers, so it starts to listen for
# container startup events in order to set up the following clients and routers.
#
# When a router starts up, the daemon will examine its labels and exec a network
# emulation command in the router based on those labels. The router takes care
# of configuring the network to fit our targets, and will run a speedtest to
# find the achieved conditions. The labels for the router will be updated to
# match the achieved conditions.
#
# When a container starts up, the daemon will examine its labels and exec
# commands to establish a vpn connection, run automated browsing, and collect
# network-stats. To properly name the network-stats output file with the current
# network conditions, a speed test is run prior to launching the behavior and
# running network-stats.
#
# After a little bit of time, the daemon will stop listening to docker startup
# events and start listening for an interrupt signal. When received, the daemon
# will teardown all clients and routers gracefully by interrupting all processes
# and waiting until the interrupts are complete before shutting down the
# containers. Then the daemon will exit itself.
#
# NOTE: Due to the way the self-timeout in implemented, any currently running
# functions seem to likewise get interrupted. Therefore it is advisable to set
# a very generous self-timeout in the function call within main.
#
# TODO: The setup for each router and client should be non-blocking.
